### ActorContext in Akka

**ActorContext** is a crucial component of Akka's actor model, providing a variety of functionalities that allow actors to interact with the Akka framework and manage their behavior. Below are the key aspects of `ActorContext`:

#### 1. Definition and Purpose

* **ActorContext** is an implicit parameter available in the `receive` method of an actor. It gives actors access to the runtime context in which they operate.
* It allows actors to perform actions like sending messages, spawning new actors, stopping themselves or other actors, and more.

#### 2. Key Features and Methods

* **Message Sending**: Actors can send messages to other actors using the `context` object. For example, `context.sender()` returns the reference of the actor that sent the current message.

```scala
context.sender() ! responseMessage
```
