### Best Practices for Actors

1. **Actors should work efficiently**:
   Like good co-workers, actors should do their tasks without unnecessarily bothering others or wasting resources. In programming, this means they should handle events and generate responses (or make requests) in an **event-driven** manner. Avoid **blocking** (i.e., passively waiting while occupying a thread) for external resources like locks, network sockets, etc., unless absolutely necessary. If blocking is unavoidable, there are other techniques to handle it.

2. **Use immutable messages**:
   **Do not pass mutable objects between actors**. Prefer using **immutable messages** to ensure that the actor's internal state isnâ€™t exposed to others. If actors expose mutable state, it returns to the same problems as regular Java concurrency, which defeats the purpose of the actor model.

3. **Keep behavior within actors**:
   Actors are designed to manage **behavior** and **state**. Avoid sending behavior in messages, such as **Scala closures** (small functions). Doing so risks sharing mutable state between actors, which breaks the core principles of the actor model.

4. **Use a hierarchical system for top-level actors**:
   **Top-level actors** are critical for error handling (known as the **Error Kernel**), so they should be created sparingly. Prefer building a clear **actor hierarchy** to handle faults and manage performance. This also reduces the load on the **guardian actor**, which manages all top-level actors. Overusing top-level actors can make the guardian actor a bottleneck.

Depending on the type of work being supervised and the nature of the failure, a supervisor has four options for handling failures:

1. **Resume** the subordinate, keeping its accumulated internal state.
2. **Restart** the subordinate, clearing out its accumulated internal state.
3. **Stop** the subordinate permanently.
4. **Escalate** the failure, causing the supervisor itself to fail.

### Actor Selection in Akka

* **Absolute Path Lookup**: You can look up an actor using the `actorSelection` method of the `ActorSystem` for absolute paths.
  
  * **Example**:
  
    ```scala
    system.actorSelection("/user/serviceA") ! msg
    ```

* **Relative Path Lookup**: Inside an actor, you can use `context.actorSelection` to look up actors relative to the current actor.
  
  * **Example**:
  
    ```scala
    context.actorSelection("../brother") ! msg
    ```

    This allows you to send messages to a specific sibling actor.

### Key Differences Between `actorSelection` and `context.actorSelection`:

1. **Starting Point**:
   * **`ActorSystem.actorSelection`**: Starts looking up from the root of the actor hierarchy.
   * **`context.actorSelection`**: Starts looking up from the current actor context.

2. **Path Elements**:
   * **`context.actorSelection`**: Can use relative paths (e.g., `..` to access parent actors).
   * **Absolute paths** may also be looked up on `context` in the usual way (e.g., `context.actorSelection("/user/serviceA") ! msg`).
